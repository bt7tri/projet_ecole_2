				&nbsp; Just by looking at where we are today, we can already see how powerful technology has been in shaping our world. Through the years, scientists have introduced cutting-edge technologies intended to make life a lot more convenient for humans. Technological advancements happen so fast that people’s current way of life always seems out of date relative to these advancements. The introduction of new-fangled pieces of knowledge especially in the fields of biotechnology and information technology has radically altered this world in so many ways, and this becomes even more evident in the continuous development of forward-looking things that people before never knew could exist.

				&nbsp; There are enormous number of technologies that make our life improve such as Artificial Intelligence, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, Robot, GMO, 3D printing, Blockchain, Autonomous Vehicle, Drone, Hyperloop, Flying Car, Artificial Meat(In-vitro Meat), Stem Cell, Robot Doctor, Robot Cop, Artificial Womb, Gene Therapy, etc. Among these, I will introduce three technologies which was already introduced through movie or pc game decades ago. Those are Robot Cop, Artificial Meat, 3D printing house.

				&nbsp; When I was young, I read some cartoons such as Dragon Ball, in which there were many unbelievable technologies. I also watched movies which introduced far advanced technologies no one could even guess at that time it could be in reality. In addition, playing some kinds of pc-game in which we could be heros/heroines in fantastic virtual worlds was a real enjoy. I was really impressed in brilliant magic, cure, technologies although those were not direct experiences. However, I never even imagined that those would come to our real world in the future. But it was a prediction of our future. Isn't it interesting?

				&nbsp; First, Robocop. RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film in which a dead policeman's body is remodeled to cyborg and fights against the drug criminals. And now, the Dubai police force strives to be 'most progressive' of all Arabic police forces and as part of this effort, the force has announced that it plans to deploy its first robot police officer by May 2017, and that their ambition is to have 25 percent of the force consist of robotic officers by 2030, as well as to operate a "smart" police station that "won't require human employees".

				&nbsp; Second, Artificial Meat. Artificial meat, also called cultured meat, clean meat, synthetic meat or in vitro meat, is meat grown from in vitro animals cell culture instead of from slaughtered animals. It is a form of cellular agriculture and is produced using many of the same tissue engineering techniques traditionally used in regenerative medicine. The concept of artificial meat was popularized by Jason Matheny in the early 2000s after co-authoring a seminal paper on cultured meat production and creating New Harvest, the world’s first non-profit organization dedicated to supporting in vitro meat research.

				&nbsp; Third, 3D Printing House. It is an application of a part of "Construction 3D Printing". Construction 3D Printing (c3Dp) or 3D Construction Printing (3DCP) refers to various technologies that use 3D printing as a core method to fabricate buildings or construction components. Alternative terms are also in use, such as Large scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), or Freeform construction (FC), also to refer to sub-groups, such as '3D Concrete', used to refer to concrete extrusion technologies. 3D printing at a construction will have a wide variety of applications within the private, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Potential advantages of these technologies include faster construction, lower labor costs, increased complexity and/or accuracy, greater integration of function and less waste produced.
