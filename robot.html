								&nbsp; Do you remember the movie "Robocop" which was published in 1987? It was more than 30 years ago! At that time, it was very hard to find even a person who has a personal PC. So no one could even guess that making a kind of robot can be possible in reality. Although there were robot toys and cartoons, it was considered as just an imagination of some dreamers. However, it came to the world after 30 years.

									Do you remember "Robocop"?				
								</video>
							</div>

							<p>
								&nbsp; Robocop is a cybog, which is made by mixing human body and machine, instead of making full parts from nothing. It was made from dead Murphy, who was a colleague of Louis. In this part of video, Louis is trying to remind Murphy of her name. But Robocop was programmed to forget every memory when he was live.

								&nbsp; The “world’s first operational Robocop” has reported for duty in Dubai, forming the first part of the emirate’s plan to make one quarter of its police force robotic by 2030. The autonomous robot policeman was unveiled at the Gulf Information Security Expo and Conference (GISEC) at Dubai World Trade Center. From 2017.05.24, it will be used on public streets in the city.

							</div>

							<p>
								&nbsp; “With an aim to assist and help people in the malls or on the streets, the Robocop is the latest smart addition to the force and has been designed to help police fight crime, keep the city safe and improve happiness levels,” said Brigadier-General Khalid Nasser Al Razzouqi, director-general of Smart Services at Dubai Police, according to the Khaleej Times.

								&nbsp; He says, “The launch of the world’s first operational Robocop is a significant milestone for the emirate and a step towards realizing Dubai’s vision to be a global leader in smart cities technology adoption.” As the technology develops further and further, the humanoid robot will become more elaborate and powerful as we could see in the movie “Robocop”.
