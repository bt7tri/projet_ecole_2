								&nbsp; Do you remember the PC game "Ultima 6" which was published in 1990? At that time, virtual world which was created in screen was beginning to expand to the mind of people in the real world. There were nothing impossible in the fantasy world which kings, wizards, knights made. It was full of fantastic adventure with powerful arcane magic.

								&nbsp; This part deals how the main character came to involve in the fantasy world. He was watching TV and found a bean-shaped obsidian stone in the circle surrounded by pebbles after a thunderstorm. He picked up the black stone, but it was a key to the magical portal to the world of devil...

								&nbsp; You may be wondering why this is mentioned although it does not seem to be related with the "artificial meat". No. It was a previous notice that it would happen in the future in the time of 1990s. Can you see the name of "magic" in the image? Yes. It is "Create Food". In this game, "Creating Food" was an important magic when the players cannot find food so that they cannot help death from starvation. At this time, it was a "magic". However, now it is not a magic any more.

								&nbsp; Back in 2013, the world watched as food critics tucked into the first ever lab-grown burger. The small pink patty, prised out of a petri dish and fried in front of the media, was proof that it was possible to grow safe and edible meat without slaughtering a single animal. There was just one problem: the patty had taken two years and over $300,000 to produce.

									Look at the meat which is made in the lab!
								</video>
							</div>

							<p>
								&nbsp; But since then the cost of producing this high-tech meat has plummeted. In January 2016, a company called Memphis Meats produced a ‘cultured meatball’ for around $1,000, and today start-ups and non-profit organisations are working on other lab-grown animal products including pork chicken, turkey, fish, milk, egg whites, gelatin, and even leather.

							</div>

							<p>
								&nbsp; Although it has not yet been commercialized, in near future, the price of cultured meat at retail outlets like grocery stores and supermarkets may decrease to levels that middle-class consumers consider to be "inexpensive" due to technological advancements. It has been claimed that, conditions being ideal, two months of cultured meat production could deliver up to 50,000 tons of meat from ten pork muscle cells. It means that people will be liberated from hunger or starvation, because food(although it is restricted to meat) can be "created". Creating food is not a magic any more!
