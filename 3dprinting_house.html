									&nbsp; Do you remember the real-time strategy game "Star Craft" which was most famous in 1998? It centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerfully enigmatic Protoss, and the "god-like" Xel'Naga creator race—in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector.

									&nbsp; In this part, what we should focus on is how fast the mechanical unit SCV builds a variety of buildings. Do you think it is possible to build a factory, barrack, bunker, armory, tank manufactory, airplane manufactory, etc? You might have thought that it was possible because it was a game, a virtual world.

									&nbsp;  However, you were wrong. It was a prediction for our future. Although many people think that 3D printer can print just small things like toys, it can print big structures such as houses. Now, you can see how fast 3D printer can build the house today. Click "The Present & The Future" with no hesitation!

									&nbsp; A decade ago, when 3-D printing promised to usher in a second industrial revolution, many saw the potential of using 3-D printers to make buildings. An architect could make a tiny model of a new home design using the resin or plastic filament in a desktop 3-D printer, then employ a similar but much larger machine to spit out a life-size version of that same design using concrete and other familiar building materials. The method looked to be cheaper and faster than traditional building, and it used fewer resources—you only print the materials you need, down to the drop.

									&nbsp; The Russian company Apis Core showed off a printer that could build a house on the spot. That house, painted orange and shaped like an igloo, cost about $10,000 and took less than 24 hours to fabricate. It hopes its technology can address housing shortages in poor areas. "Using our technology we can build houses faster, cheaper, and qualitatively enough with a small number of people involved," says Anna Cheniuntai, Apis Cor's head of marketing. "It allows us to provide affordable housing for a lot of people in short period of time."

									&nbsp; Critics worry that these companys, like all the others in the 3-D-printing space, will have difficulty scaling up. But New Story's Lafci doesn't want to wait for the technology to trickle down to the regions with lean economies. "It will take many years before 3-D-printed homes are printing the types of homes that you and I would live in, but the tech is ready now to print very high-quality, safe homes in the places we're building," she says. What we saw in Star Craft is not a fantasy any more!
